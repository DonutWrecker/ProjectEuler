# ProjectEuler

This repository is devoted to my personal studies regarding C#, and includes solutions to the problems presented in https://projecteuler.net/. Since the only reason that this repository exists is to record my studies while trying to solidify my knowledge as I learn C#, the solutions I've provided for the problems in this repository represents my knowledge about the language at the time I provided the solution. If you are going to use these solutions to learn about how to solve the problem you're interested in, know that these solutions may not be the optimal solutions to these problems.
